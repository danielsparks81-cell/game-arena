//   1. YAW — rotate the flat pointy-top center `hexToPixel` about the origin by
//      `ISO_ROTATE_DEG` (the "camera angle"). 0° = head-on (rows recede straight
//      up the screen); 45° = classic corner-on isometric, where BOTH axes recede
//      and two faces of every column show.
//   2. SQUASH — compress the result vertically by `ISO_SQUASH` so the ground
//      reads as receding under a tilted camera.
//   3. LIFT — raise the top face up the screen (−y) by `height * ISO_LEVEL_H`,
//      the column depth.
// Steps 1–2 are a single AFFINE map, and affine maps send a tiling to a tiling,
// so the projected top hexagons still abut perfectly edge-to-edge — no seams —
// at ANY yaw. (This generalises the original pure-squash variant; the spec's
// literal `(q-r, q+r)` is simply the yaw=45° special case of the rotation.)
